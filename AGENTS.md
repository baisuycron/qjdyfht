# Prototype Instructions

Run the local server yourself and open the preview in the browser available to this environment. Do not give the user server-start instructions when you can run it.

Before making substantial visual changes, use the Product Design plugin's `get-context` skill when the visual source is unclear or no longer matches the current goal. When the user gives durable prototype-specific design feedback, preferences, or decisions, record them in `AGENTS.md`.

ERP 满减满赠类活动在营销入口中拆分为“满减满赠”“满额+XX元换购”“买X送Y”三个独立的只读列表/详情入口，页面复用限时折扣的筛选、表格和详情视觉语言。
“满减满赠”原型数据应覆盖接口中的不同规则形态，包括金额/数量满减、固定赠品、候选赠品任选、任选多件、最低售价赠品，以及条件商品任一满足或全部满足。

When implementing from a selected generated mock, treat that image as the source of truth for layout, component anatomy, density, spacing, color, typography, visible content, and hierarchy.

For the limited-discount list, provide query controls for activity name (fuzzy, max 100 characters), activity number (exact, max 50 characters), and discount method (single-select: all, discount rate, promotional price, price reduction). Label this field and its table column “优惠方式”.

Calculate limited-discount activity status from the current China Standard Time and the activity interval: before `starttime` is “未开始”, from `starttime` through `endtime` inclusive is “进行中”, and after `endtime` is “已结束”. Do not display a stored status field.

For the combination-price list, do not provide a last-modified-time query. Query by combination code (exact, max 50 characters) and combination name (fuzzy, max 100 characters); blank fields mean all combinations.

Build app UI in `src/`. Keep `.openai/hosting.json`, `worker/index.js`, `scripts/prepare-sites-build.mjs`, and `tests/sites-worker.test.mjs` intact so the same local prototype can be handed to Sites. Before a Sites handoff, run `npm run build` and `npm run test:sites`; the build must leave `dist/client/index.html`, `dist/server/index.js`, and `dist/.openai/hosting.json`.
